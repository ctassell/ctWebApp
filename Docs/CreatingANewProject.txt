Create the same directory structure and symlink or copy in the files.
For public/index.php you need to copy it, as that is where you do your

separate and update index.php paths.  Or checkout zf2App to
externals/zf2App and set that in the include path)

The system reads config files based on the "deployment" variable,
which is first loaded by checkign the ZF2_DEPLOYMENT environmental
variable.  If that doesn't exist it looks for a file called
deployment.txt in the conf dir, which should be a single line with
the name of the deployment to use.  If that file doesn't exist, it
defaults to using "charles".  The config file to be loaded will be
<deployment>ini IE: charles.ini


You need a copy of the adodb_lite DB abstraction library, and the path
to it needs to be specified in the paths[] and adodb.inc.php in libs[]
of the config file.

You also need to enable mod_rewrite on the server and copy
htaccess.example to .htaccess and update it with the proper URLs and
paths.

Once you have all the files copied and the config setup done, edit
index.php and change the name of the base class to whatever your
app is called, then change the formHandler method with your
proper routes.  You might also want to update
